| react/react-dom   | vuejs, Angular, Svelte                | React is positioned as the industry standard for building web UIs, and due to its wide industry adoption and solid plugin support it was the best choice for this project.                                                                                                                                                        |

With 5+ million weekly downloads it is recognised and trusted by the community.                                                                                                                                              |
| react-router      | TanStack Router                       | React-router is the most recognised and widely adopted routing plugin for React. While other options such as the TanStact Router exist, react-router was selected for its simple integration and recognisable syntax.                                                                                                             |

ESLint/Prettier is still the more popular choice, however with the intention to base the style guide off the AirBnB guide, and use of ES9 features, Biome was chosen for it's integration into ES9 where the AirBnB style guide directly through ESLint requires substantial additional configuration. |
| React Testing Library (@testing-library/react, user-event) | ReactTestUtils, Browser mode testing | RTL provides a user-centric way to test React components, by focusing on how a user would interact with the UI, allowing an easy method to follow best testing practices for React applications.

Due to its modern usage and network level interception of API calls, it was selected for this project despite lower community adoption.                                                                                                                             |
